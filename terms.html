    <!-- 1. Introduction -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">1. Introduction</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>1.1 Agreement.</strong>
      Welcome to PrizePaths (“PrizePaths,” “we,” “our,” “us”). These Terms &amp; Conditions (“Terms”)
      govern your access to and use of the PrizePaths website, forms, surveys, promotions and any
      related services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to
      these Terms and our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>1.2 Privacy Policy.</strong>
      By using the Service you confirm you’ve read and agree to our Privacy Policy, which explains
      how we collect, use, and share personal information and cookies/trackers.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>1.3 No Access Without Agreement.</strong>
      If you don’t agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>1.4 Who we are.</strong>
      PrizePaths is a promotions and product-discovery platform that features sponsored and
      affiliate offers. Some links are affiliate links — we may earn a commission if you act on an
      offer, at no extra cost to you.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>1.5 Subject to Availability (Very Important).</strong>
      All giveaways, samples, rewards, and promotional items are strictly subject to availability and
      may be limited by region, inventory, eligibility, or sponsor terms. We may substitute items
      of equal or greater approximate retail value where lawful and practical.
    </p>

    <!-- 2. Eligibility -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">2. Eligibility</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>2.1 Age &amp; Residency.</strong>
      The Service is intended for individuals 18 years or older. Giveaways may be limited to
      residents of Australia or the United States (or specific states/territories) where permitted by
      law. Void where prohibited.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>2.2 Accounts.</strong>
      You agree to provide accurate information and to keep it current. You are responsible for
      maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity under your
      account.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>2.3 One Person, One Account.</strong>
      No pseudonyms or false identities. We may ask for reasonable verification (e.g., email or
      phone confirmation).
    </p>

    <!-- 3. How Giveaways & Offers Work -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">3. How Giveaways &amp; Offers Work</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>3.1 No Purchase Necessary.</strong>
      Entry into giveaways does not require a purchase. A purchase will not increase your chances
      of winning.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>3.2 Paths &amp; Surveys.</strong>
      Some promotions may require you to complete a short survey to help us match you with
      relevant partner offers. Survey completion does not guarantee a giveaway item.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>3.3 Subject to Availability &amp; Substitution.</strong>
      Supplies are limited. We do not guarantee that any particular entrant will receive a sample,
      prize, or box. Where permitted, we may substitute a different item of equal or greater
      approximate value if the originally described item is unavailable.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>3.4 Winners/Recipients.</strong>
      Selection methods may include random draws, eligibility criteria, location, inventory, and
      sponsor requirements. Selected entrants may be notified by email and may need to respond
      within a stated period or the selection may be forfeited.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>3.5 Delivery.</strong>
      Shipping may be limited by geography. Delivery timelines are estimates only. Sponsor or
      supplier may fulfill directly.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>3.6 Taxes.</strong>
      Winners/recipients are responsible for any applicable taxes, reporting obligations, or customs
      fees.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>3.7 Publicity/Reviews.</strong>
      If you submit a review, testimonial, photo, or feedback, you grant PrizePaths a
      non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, display, and adapt that
      content for marketing and operational purposes. If you received an item for free in exchange
      for a review, disclose that fact when posting publicly (as required by law).
    </p>

    <!-- 4. Sponsored & Affiliate Offers -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">4. Sponsored &amp; Affiliate Offers</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>4.1 Disclosure.</strong>
      Some links are affiliate links. If you click through and take action (e.g., purchase, sign up,
      trial), we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>4.2 Third-Party Terms.</strong>
      Third-party websites, apps, and offers are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.
      We don’t control or endorse third-party content, products, or services and aren’t liable for
      them.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>4.3 Accuracy.</strong>
      We aim to keep partner information current, but prices, availability, and terms may change
      without notice. Always check the final offer page before acting.
    </p>

    <!-- 5. User Conduct -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">5. User Conduct (What’s Not Allowed)</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      You agree not to: (a) harass or harm others; (b) impersonate any person or entity;
      (c) interfere with the Service or attempt unauthorized access; (d) use bots or automated tools
      to enter, scrape, or harvest data; (e) post unlawful, defamatory, obscene, hateful, or
      infringing content; (f) manipulate entries or create multiple or fake accounts; (g) bypass
      technical measures; (h) misrepresent eligibility or location.
    </p>

    <!-- 6. Intellectual Property -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">6. Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>6.1 Ownership.</strong>
      The Service (including text, graphics, logos, and design) is owned by PrizePaths or our
      licensors and is protected by IP laws.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>6.2 Limited License.</strong>
      We grant you a revocable, non-transferable, limited license to use the Service for personal,
      non-commercial purposes per these Terms.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>6.3 DMCA (U.S.).</strong>
      If you believe content on the Service infringes your copyright, send a notice to
      <a href="mailto:support@prizepaths.com" class="underline">support@prizepaths.com</a> with:
      (i) your signature, (ii) identification of the work, (iii) identification of the allegedly
      infringing material and its location, (iv) your contact info, and (v) a statement of
      good-faith belief and accuracy under penalty of perjury. We will respond as legally required.
    </p>

    <!-- 7. Consumer Law & Disclaimers -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">7. Consumer Law &amp; Disclaimers</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>7.1 Australia — Australian Consumer Law (ACL).</strong>
      Nothing in these Terms excludes, restricts, or modifies any consumer guarantees, rights, or
      remedies you may have under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) and the
      Australian Consumer Law that cannot be excluded by contract. If any non-excludable
      guarantee applies, our liability for breach is limited, where permitted, to the resupply of the
      services or the cost of resupply.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>7.2 United States — Disclaimers.</strong>
      The Service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. To the fullest extent permitted
      by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a
      particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant continuous, error-free
      operation, availability of any particular item, or delivery times.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>7.3 Limitation of Liability (general).</strong>
      To the maximum extent allowed by law, PrizePaths and its affiliates are not liable for
      indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or any loss of
      profits, data, or goodwill, arising from or related to your use of the Service, third-party
      offers, or promotions. Where liability cannot be excluded, it is limited to the lesser of the
      amount you paid to use the Service in the 12 months before the claim or AUD/USD $100.
    </p>

    <!-- 8. Dispute Resolution -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">8. Dispute Resolution; Governing Law</h3>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>8.1 Informal Resolution First.</strong>
      Contact us at
      <a href="mailto:support@prizepaths.com" class="underline">support@prizepaths.com</a> so we
      can try to resolve issues informally.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>8.2 United States Users — Arbitration &amp; Class-Action Waiver.</strong>
      If you reside in the U.S., any dispute with us arising out of or relating to these Terms or the
      Service will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, administered by JAMS
      under its Streamlined Rules. No class actions or class arbitrations. You and PrizePaths each
      waive the right to a jury trial. Venue for hearings will be the JAMS location closest to your
      residence unless otherwise agreed. Each party bears its own attorneys’ fees unless a statute
      provides otherwise.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>8.3 Australian Users — Courts &amp; ACCC.</strong>
      If you reside in Australia, these Terms are governed by the laws of the State/Territory where
      you live and applicable federal law. You agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of courts in
      that State/Territory. Nothing limits your rights to make a complaint to the ACCC or your
      State/Territory consumer affairs body.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3">
      <strong>8.4 International Users.</strong>
      If your mandatory local law provides you with additional rights or a different forum, those
      rights are preserved to the extent they cannot be waived.
    </p>

    <!-- 9. Changes to the Service -->
    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">9. Changes to the Service or Terms</h3>

      posted on the site with a new “Last updated” date. If you continue using the Service after
      changes post, you accept the updated Terms.

    <h3 class="mt-10 mb-3 text-xl font-semibold">10. Communications</h3>
